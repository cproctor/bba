Title: Interface design
Index: 6.2

Working alone or with your Tech in the Wild partner, propose a redesigned 
interface for some technology you observed during 
[Tech in the Wild]({filename}/assignments/tech-in-wild.md). 
The first step is to identify the technology whose interface you plan to 
redesign The focus here is on the interface--don't fundamentally redesign 
the technology, but redesign how the user interacts with it, understands 
it, creates meaning with it.

Be clear about the scope of the interface as you understand it. Are you 
redesigning a software dashboard? The physical form of a tool? How users 
interact with a space? This should be the result of several design iterations. 
The readings for the next two weeks of lecture provide lots of concepts that 
can be helpful here. Be prepared to share your design in class.

# Deliverables

**Your detailed interface**, in a format which visually or materially 
communicates the (re)designed interface. If the result is a digital 
document it should be comparable in detail to the 
[interface design case studies]({filename}/curriculum/interface.md). 
If it is a functional prototype, it needs to enact specific design 
choices rather than exploring a general idea. A functional prototype 
is different from a conceptual prototype. If you are designing an interface 
for a machine that has buttons, your interface needs to have buttons. 
They don't have to do anything, but they do need to reflect specific 
decisions about what, where, how.

**A brief writeup** explaining your design choices in terms of the intended 
users and the learning goals. Explain how you want your user to think or 
interact with your interface, and connect this to specific design choices 
in the interface as well as to observations and insights from your 
[Tech in the Wild]({filename}/assignments/tech-in-wild.md) report. Aim for 
~300 words. Possible formats:

- Annotated screenshots, wireframes, or sketches (See Teacher Portal or Student 
  Journalism in the [interface design case studies]({filename}/curriculum/interface.md))
- A list of user stories with interface features supporting them (See 
  Interactive Storytelling in the [interface design case studies]({filename}/curriculum/interface.md))
- Several paragraphs summarizing your design process, explaining what you 
  were trying to achieve and options you considered for achieving it.

# Assessment

- ** &#10003; + ** Meets all requirements described above. Connections between
  theories of learning and theories of design are explicitly connected and
  engage with specific evidence from your design research to make a compelling
  case of how and why the proposed interface might be effective. 
- ** &#10003; ** Meets all requirements described above. The documents or
  artifacts you create feel considered and complete. The interface is explicitly
  connected to a theory of learning, draws on your design research, and is
  informed by theories of design considered in lecture. 
- ** &#10003; - ** Does not meet the requirements described above.
