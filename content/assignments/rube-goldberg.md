## Steps

Goal: "A Rube Goldberg machine is a contraption, invention, device or apparatus that is deliberately over-engineered to perform a simple task in a complicated fashion, generally including a chain reaction (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. The expression is named after American (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. cartoonist (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. and inventor Rube Goldberg (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. (1883â€“1970)." (Wikipedia)

As an entire class, you will build a single Rube Goldberg Machine, using the GoGo boards with various sensors and actuators, the laser cutter, and other tools at your availability in the lab. The Rube Goldberg Machine you build will consist of 7 stations, each of which takes a particular sensor input and has to activate the following sensor in a wonderfully complicated way. The class will be split into 7 groups, each group responsible for one station.

Organization of the Group Collaboration:

You have to work in the groups you are assigned to. We have compiled the group information in this sheet (link here (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.). Please enter a contact info in the corresponding column so that the other groups know who to contact. You have to make sure what sensor you have to activate for the following team (should be clear from the sheet), and how they will arrange the sensor (hi up, on the table, flat, vertical, etc.). Group 1 has to activate their sensor however they want. Group 7 has to create the finale.

Set up a shared google doc in canvas in the collaboration tab. This will be used to document your working progress.

Deliverables/Rubric:

    You have to have at least 1 step between the input sensor and the following sensor. A step consists of the activation of an actuator by the input sensor, that then triggers the following sensor.
    It has to have active movable parts. Movement can be with linkages, gears, ropes being pulled, wheel systems, chain of marbles or balls rolling triggered by the actuator, etc.; there is no limit to what that entails.
    It has to contain lasercut elements.
    The sensor-actuator system has to be all implemented using the GoGo board and the corresponding pieces.
    Extra Credit: Incorporate a 3D printed element in your design. Extra bonus points for creating the design yourself with 123D Design, Tinkercad, Oculus Medium, or some other 3D design software. 
    Documentation:
        4 - 6 pictures of the actual working process (brainstorming, designs, prototyping, etc.) and the final prototype. Include these pictures into the google doc you set up with canvas. Include a caption or description of each picture along with supporting text to help us understand your design process and final prototype.
        1 video of your station at work in the google doc.
        Submit the final google doc as a link to the assignment.

Materials:

You can use basically anything in the lab that can be modified with the techniques you have learned. There are boxes with a lot of random stuff, we have enough cardboard, wood and other materials, we have tubes in the back, etc. If you need anything special, please let us know asap.

Learning Goals:

This project requires you to utilize the core techniques we have covered in lab so far. After this project, you should be familiar with using CorelDraw or other drawing software to produce laser cut pieces, be familiar with using the gogo board to set up sensor-actuator system, gain experience with 3D design and 3D printing (optional), and know what to take into consideration and where to get help. In particular, you will have learned how to go about designing a functioning prototype, and how to work not just within a group, but also across groups.
