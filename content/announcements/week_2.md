Title: Preparing for Week 2
Index: -4

Hi everyone, we're looking forward to our second week together. A few housekeeping items to prepare for this week:

- We got a bigger, better room for lecture: Horace Mann 438. See you there on Wednesday morning. 
- Please fill out the [Lab Journal form]({filename}/assignments/lab_journals.md) so we can read your lab journal. 
- We are going to use Processing in lecture and lab this week. If you are planning to use your own computer, please install the following software:
    - [Processing3](https://processing.org/download/)
    - [Python mode](https://github.com/jdf/processing.py#python-mode-for-processing) for Processing 
    - A [physics simulation](https://github.com/cproctor/physics_simulation) Processing project
- If you haven't yet joined the course Piazza, please do so. There's a link in the menu above.
