Title: Coffee
Date: 2018-01-11

You are welcome to use the espresso maker as long as you clean up after yourself. Frequent users are encouraged to bring a mug. 

# Usage
- To avoid surprises, make sure all the switches are turned off and the steam knob is shut.
- Turn on the power switch. The light indicates that the machine is heating. Once the light turns off, the machine is ready.
- Check the water reservoir and fill it if necessary. Make sure you only use food-safe containers to transfer water.

## For espresso
- Choose whether you want one shot or two and use the appropriate basket. Fill the basket with finely ground coffee. 
  Use the tamper to tamp it down firmly; the basket should be filled up to the crimp on the inside.
- Install the basket by sliding it into the machine and pulling the wooden handle to the right. If it won't go, you used too
  much coffee. Don't force it. 
- Position the espresso cup under the basket. 
- Once the light turns off, turn on the coffee button until the cup is nearly full.
- Ideally, you'll see a small but steady trickle of espresso, and it will take 10-12 seconds to fill the cup.

## For hot water
- Turn on the hot water button and wait for the light to turn off. 
- Put your cup under the wand and open the steam knob to release hot water. 

## For steam
- Turn on the steam button and wait for the light to turn off. 
- If you're steaming milk, pour a little milk into your cup (it will increase in volume).
- Submerge the end of the wand and gently open the steam knob. Hot steam going into cold milk often makes a loud noise. It's ok.
- If you're going for cappucino foam, try to keep the end of the wand near the top of the milk. It's an art.

# Troubleshooting
- If the espresso comes out too fast and is weak, maybe you didn't add enough grounds, they were ground too coarsely, 
  or you didn't tamp it hard enough.
- If the espresso doesn't come out at all, or is really bitter, your grounds might be too fine, or you packed them too hard.
- If there's no crema (thick foam on top of the espresso), maybe the grounds are too old.

# Cleanup
- Empty your coffee grounds, rinse the basket and the espresso cup, close up the coffee, and put it away. 
- If you used the steam wand to froth milk, clean it with a wet paper towel. 
- Leave the espresso machine ready for the next user. 
- Turn off the machine and all switches unless someone else is waiting to use it.
