Title: Heading into Week 2
Date: 2018-01-15

It was so exciting to kick off the course and meet everyone last Thursday. It has also been fun to see people starting to get comfortable with the lab--we'll end up spending a lot of time together! We have a few announcements as we head into week 2:

- If you haven't joined our class on Piazza yet, please do so.
- If possible, please pay the $75 lab fee this week in lab with a check made out to Stanford University. If this presents a financial hardship for you, please contact a member of the teaching team. 
- Lab journals will not arrive until Thursday, so we will have slightly different procedures for journals this week. Please see the <a href="{filename}/assignments/omni-animal.md">Omni-Animal</a> assignment for details. 
- Hopefully your Stanford ID card will start unlocking the lab starting on Tuesday. Until then, check Piazza to see when somebody is in the lab to let you in. 
- Have you been enjoying watching a bunch of professional teachers and computer scientists struggle to use Canvas? We should have all the readings and assignment submission pages up in the next day or so. 

See you on Thursday.
