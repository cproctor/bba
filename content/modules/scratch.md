Title: Scratch
Date: 2017-12-15

This is the Scratch module. It will include a link to slides and notes.

### Development notes

- See <a class="assignment-out" href="{filename}/assignments/omni-animal.md">Omni Animal</a> for 
  the requirements of how students should use 
- Would be good to introduce python's turtle library as an alternative interface. 
- Check out <a href="https://github.com/donkirkby/live-py-plugin/blob/master/test/PySrc/tools/svg_example.py">svg turtle</a> library--perhaps we could provide a wrapper function like that in the example, so that students could
    use computational design to cut (with vectors) as well as etch (with raster-based image). 
- Possible topics: 
    - ellipses
    - polygons
    - bezier curves (more advanced)
    - maze generation
    - tesselations and repeated patterns
- This would be a good topic for reflection at the end of our first class. Many people once learned the math for 
  computational design, but they probably never actually used it. It might feel pretty different to actually 
  put it to use. (this is the core premise of turtle logo.)
