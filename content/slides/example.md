# Writing slides in markdown

## Some examples

---

# You don't have to use this

We need slides for modules, class meetings, etc. You're quite welcome to 
create them with Google Docs (in the BBA Drive folder) and add links.

# But you might want to

- If you're tired of fiddling with formatting, and just want to type slides as text
- If you're ideologically committed to people having empowered and empowering relationships 
  with technology, and you think not contributing to corporate network effects contributes
  to that goal
- If you just want to try something new

???

In the case of BBA, it's also helpful to have slides in version control, so that we can 
keep track of changes from year to year. There are a lot of reasons to prefer text files.

# How it works

- Just write a standard [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)
  file and add `template: slides.html` to the page metadata.
- As an example, have a look at [the source code for this slideshow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cproctor/bba/master/content/slides/example.md).
- [Here's a slideshow](https://remarkjs.com/#1) explaining how the Markdown is turned into slides
- Try pressing `c` to clone the slideshow window. Then, in the new window, press `p` 
- This works well for professional presentations too.cite[1]
