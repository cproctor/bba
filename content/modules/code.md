### Dev Notes

In this station, we will introduce core computational concepts that will be useful to anyone 
using code in a serious way. Should address events and I/O; Model-View architecture; State and variables; 
Functions and modularization.

Proposed format of this station is give groups of students a game implemented on TUIO tables, have them
play it, and then study the code. Then discuss the ideas and how they are implemented.
