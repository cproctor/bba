Title: After BBA
Date: 2018-03-05

Dear students, 

As you dive into the final weeks of BB&A, we encourage you to start thinking about where your project will go after the class ends. This is up to you, but there are a few concrete opportunities to consider:

1. **Feedback on your final project**. When you turn in your final project and paper, we will ask you what kind of feedback you want/need. We’ll give you different feedback if you are planning to work in a school and implement this next year, planning to continue this as academic research, or if you are planning to commercialize your product. And if you’re planning to turn this in as a class project and then move on to other things, that’s fine too! 
2. **Submitting to IDC**. We encourage you to submit your final project & paper to [IDC](http://idc-2018.org/). Please contact individual members of the teaching team if you would like to collaborate on revising your work for submission after the class ends. 
3. **Independent study**. If you would like to keep working on this project as a spring quarter independent study with support and possible funding for materials and equipment from TLTL we will ask you to send us a brief proposal describing the goals of your proposed research, a timeline, and what resources (lab access, meetings, funding) you will need. RAships are also possible.
4. **Funding**. Your project might be a good fit for a [TELOS grant](https://telos.stanford.edu/funding-opportunities). The application deadline has been extended to March 30.
