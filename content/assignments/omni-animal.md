Title: Omni Animal
Index: 1.3
Banner: images/omni_fish.png

Design and build an Omni-Animal. In this assignment, you will get comfortable with working in the TLTL, and with using the laser cutter to prototype two- and three-dimensional objects. Alternative: Propose creating another object,
useful or beautiful, of similar complexity as an Omni-Animal. Your project should still meet the same technical requirements.

Starting with paper, cardboard, and 2D design tools, develop an idea for your omni-animal. Then use Inkscape to design your cut files. After cutting your design, use paint or craft materials found in the lab to augment your omni-animals. Cardboard is cheap, robust, and easy to work with, it makes an excellent prototyping material. Always cut your initial iterations with cardboard. Consider cutting a prototype before you have finalized your design--many people find physical prototypes help their design work. ** Your final design should be cut out of a more structural material such as plywood or mdf. ** Save time for tweaks!

- ** 2D design: ** Use [Inkscape]({filename}/modules/2d_design.md) or another 2D design tool to create vector-based and raster-based designs. Your omni-animal should be in wood or mdf and have both cuts and etched details.
- ** Connecting pieces: ** Create three-dimensional objects from two-dimensional components.
- ** Prototyping: ** Cut out omni-animal parts defined by vector images using the [laser cutter]({filename}/modules/lasercutter.md) in cardboard to test your design (low-fidelity prototype).
- ** Iterating and finishing: ** Cut out your high-fidelity omni-animal in a more structural material such as plywood or MDF (final version).
- ** Engraving and scoring: ** Score vector patterns and etch raster-based images using the [laser cutter]({filename}/modules/lasercutter.md).
- ** Giving it a soul: ** Use paint and the craft objects in the lab to decorate your omni-animal.

## Deliverables

Be ready to show off your Omni-Animal at the beginning of the lab class on Week 2. Create one or more posts in your lab journal containing the following. (This counts as your required journal post for the week.)

- Some evidence of your planning process. This might include photos, sketches, early prototypes.
- Images of your final cut files.
- Images of your final omni-animal.

## Assessment

- ** &#10003; + ** Meets all requirements described above and develops a substantially new technique. Provide a write-up for the website explaining the technique and how to use it.
- ** &#10003; ** Meets all requirements described above.
- ** &#10003; - ** Does not meet the requirements described above.
