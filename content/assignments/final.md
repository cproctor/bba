Title: Final project
Index: 100

The joint project for the two courses is a working prototype of a constructionist educational technology, to be displayed at the [BB&A Expo]({filename}/logistics/expo.md), and an accompanying paper suitable for submission to an academic conference related to education and technology. You will select a conference appropriate for your project and hopefully also your professional goals, and write a paper according to the conference's submission guidelines. [Here is a list of ACM conferences](https://sigchi.org/conferences/upcoming-conferences/).  Conferences differ, but there is typically a category of demos which or short papers approximately four pages long. When a poster is the most appropriate submission format (for example, [ISTE](https://conference.iste.org/2019/presenters/pdfs/ISTE2019_submission_guide.pdf)), you will still be required to submit a paper for the BBA final assignment. It is not a course requirement to actually submit your paper to a conference.  You may also propose a different venue, but you must be writing for some authentic audience.

In prior years, BBA was taught on a different schedule, and students were required to write papers suitable for submission to [IDC](http://idc-2018.org/) as a [Demo Paper](http://idc-2018.org/demos-art-installations/). In the last two years, 12 student papers were accepted and presented at IDC. Final projects have also gone on to become commercial products. The following IDC demo papers are excellent examples for your own final project:

Sometimes course projects go on to become more substantial research projects. If you are interested in inviting a BB&amp;A teacher to collaborate as a co-author, we can support your revision process after the class ends to avoid any conflict of interest. 

# Timeline

# Support

This is a lot of work, but we will support you along the way. In addition to class work time and office hours, your group will be having regular 1-on-1 meetings with members of the teaching team.
