Title: Final project
Index: 100

The joint project for the two courses is a working prototype of a constructionist educational technology, to be displayed at the [BB&A Expo]({filename}/logistics/expo.md), and an accompanying paper suitable for submission to [IDC](http://idc-2018.org/) as a [Demo Paper](http://idc-2018.org/demos-art-installations/). In the last two years, 12 student papers were accepted and presented at IDC. Final projects have also gone on to become commercial products. The following IDC demo papers are excellent examples for your own final project:

You are not required to submit your final project to IDC, but we encourage you to! The submission deadline is several weeks after the end of class, which gives you time to revise your work. If you are interested in including a BB&amp;A teacher as a co-author, we can support your revision process after the class ends.

# Class

The class will prepare you to write a paper which presents your project and grounds its design in educational theory.

# Lab

The lab will support you in building a final prototype of your project to be presented at the [BB&A Expo]({filename}/logistics/expo.md).
