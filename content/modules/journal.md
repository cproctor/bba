Title: Lab Journal

Slug: labjournal

We’d like for you to keep a journal on your learning through Lab Projects as the weeks progress. We want you to pay special attention to the choices that you make as you explore multiple ideas, leverage social and material resources and seek feedback. It would be useful to draw on how your experiences connect to models of learning from critical pedagogy, constructivism and constructionism.
In addition, we’d like for you to use this space to reflect on how you draw on your prior interests, if at all, to inform your projects. For example, if you enjoy writing fiction or making film, maybe you draw on them as you work on projects and develop new skills. (You don’t have to.)
The above ideas are not comprehensive, and we’d like for you to keep this as a reflection journal. The goals of this assignment are two-fold:

- Primarily, as a meta-reflection journal where you reflect on the ‘what’ and ‘how’ of your learning
- As a resource for the teaching team to provide formative feedback and support your ideas.

The form of this journal is entirely open. The content doesn’t even have to make sense. You could jot your thoughts, draw, illustrate with diagrams, doodle, write prose, poetry etc. Most importantly, have fun with it.
There is a box in the corner of the Lab, where you’ll have to drop the journals every weekend. One of the Teaching Assistants will quickly look through them to draw on these to improve your learning experience as the learning progresses. The content won’t be assessed. It is mandatory to maintain it though. Needless to say, the readers will be discreet. You’ll get your journal back every Monday, so hold on to your thoughts over the weekend.
