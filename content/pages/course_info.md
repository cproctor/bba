## Lab fee
The $75 lab fee supports the TLTL facilities and covers basic supplies such as cardboard, plywood, and other materials
stocked by the lab. Excellent final projects can be created using materials stocked by the lab, but students wishing 
to use materials or technologies not stocked by the lab may spend up to an additional $100. 

## Final project
The joint project for the two courses is a working prototype of a constructionist educational technology, to be displayed at the [BB&A Expo]({filename}/logistics/expo.md), and an accompanying paper suitable for submission to [IDC](http://idc-2018.org/) as a [Demo Paper](http://idc-2018.org/demos-art-installations/). In 2017, 6 papers from BB&A students and instructors were accepted to IDC. Final projects have also gone on to become commercial products.
