Title: Preparing for the first lab
Date: 2018-01-11

We can't wait to see you in the lab this afternoon. If you have a chance, please do the following before we meet at 3pm sharp:

- Create an account on <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>.
- If you plan to use your own computer in the lab, install <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a>. 
  (We have plenty of lab computers, but some people like to work on their own machines.)
- Fill out this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/AtcUlSiRz85W1mHH3">info sheet</a> so we can get you all set up with lab access and accounts.
