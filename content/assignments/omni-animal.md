Title: Omni Animal
Index: 1.3

Design and build an Omni-Animal. In this assignment, you will get comfortable with working in the TLTL, and with using the laser cutter to prototype two- and three-dimensional objects. Alternative: Propose creating another object, 
useful or beautiful, of similar complexity as an Omni-Animal. Your project should still meet the same technical requirements. 

Starting with paper, cardboard, and 2D design tools, develop an idea for your omni-animal. Then use Inkscape to design your cut files. As cardboard is cheap, robust, and easy to work with, it makes an excellent prototyping material. Always cut your initial iterations with cardboard. Consider cutting a prototype before you have finalized your design--many people find physical prototypes help their design work. Save time for tweaks!

- ** 2D design: ** Use [Inkscape]({filename}/modules/2d_design.md) or another 2D design tool to create vector-based and raster-based designs. Your omni-animal should have both cuts and etched details.
- ** Cutting out shapes: ** Cut out shapes defined by vector images using the [laser cutter]({filename}/modules/lasercutter.md). 
- ** Etching: ** Etch raster-based images using the [laser cutter]({filename}/modules/lasercutter.md). 
- ** Connecting pieces: ** Create three-dimensional objects from two-dimensional components.

## Deliverables

Be ready to show off your Omni-Animal at the beginning of class on Week 2. Create one or more posts in your lab journal containing the following. (This counts as your required journal post for the week.)

- Some evidence of your planning process. This might include photos, sketches, early prototypes. 
- Images of your final cut files.
- Images of your final omni-animal. 

## Assessment

- ** &#10003; + ** Meets all requirements described above and develops a substantially new technique. Provide a write-up for the website explaining the technique and how to use it. 
- ** &#10003; ** Meets all requirements described above.
- ** &#10003; - ** Does not meet the requirements described above.
