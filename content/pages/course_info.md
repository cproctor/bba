Beyond Bits & Atoms teaches students to design, build, and critique constructionist educational technologies. BB&A consists of a theory-oriented class (MSTU 5199 001) and a practice-focused lab (MSTU 5199 002); students are required to enroll in both. The theory class is focused on answering three questions:

- How does learning work?
- How does schooling work?
- How can technology affect learning and schooling?

Students explore constructivism, constructionism, and critical pedagogy, as well as embodied and situated cognition, the role of media and tools, representations and models in learning, and theories of technology design. These ideas are applied to case studies of schools and educational technologies, and to the design of a new educational technology.

In the lab, students are immersed in a constructionist learning environment where they reflect on their own learning processes as they learn to use technologies for prototyping and digital fabrication. Students use these tools to design nand build a constructionist educational technology.

## Final project
The joint project for the two courses is a working prototype of a constructionist educational technology, to be displayed at the [BB&A Expo]({filename}/logistics/expo.md), and an accompanying paper suitable for submission to [IDC](http://idc-2018.org/) as a [Demo Paper](http://idc-2018.org/demos-art-installations/). In 2017, 6 papers from BB&A students and instructors were accepted to IDC. Final projects have also gone on to become commercial products.

## Grading
You will find that motivation in this class comes from your own curiosity and playfulness, augmented by tools, media, and a supportive community of learners. This is a unique opportunity at Stanford to experience constructionist learning, and motivating students with punitive grades would interfere with the dynamics which are the focus of the class. We have high expectations for students in BB&A, and the class requires a lot of work, but if you show up, work hard, and open yourself to new experiences you will end up with a good grade in the class. If you are not meeting our expectations, we will let you know early and often, so that nobody is surprised at the end of the class. Students in prior cohorts have gone on to start companies, pursue new research trajectories, or reshape their own career goals through the class. Make these your goals, rather than an A.

You can expect regular personalized feedback on your work, in person and in writing. Assignments are evaluated using a simple scale:

- ** &#10003; + ** or Exceeds Expectations: Goes above and beyond the requirements of the assignment. This score recognizes really outstanding work; there is not always a specific formula for how to achieve it.
- ** &#10003; ** or Meets Expectations: Meets the requirements of the assignment.
- ** &#10003; - ** or Approaches Expectations: Does not meet all the requirements of the assignment.
- Incomplete: Requires additional support.

If you are regularly getting evaluations of &#10003; or above, you are on track for an A.

## Lab fee
The $75 lab fee supports the TLTL facilities and covers basic supplies such as cardboard, plywood, and other materials
stocked by the lab. Excellent final projects can be created using materials stocked by the lab, but students wishing
to use materials or technologies not stocked by the lab may spend up to an additional $100.

## Readings
We have done our best to assign a reasonable amount of reading for each week. Each week we will engage in activities and discussions that assume you have done the readings and have questions or thoughts to share.

## Assignment Feedback
For the  lecture, students will turn in each assignments on Canvas as links to Google Docs, and we will add feedback directly on the document. We spend a lot of time giving feedback; it is an important part of the course that gives us a way to address students’ misconceptions, point students in more productive directions, and suggest additional readings. We expect students to read our feedback and to be prepared to discuss it during the lecture.

We will use selections from your assignments in whole-class discussions each week. For each assignment, we have an initial round of in-class feedback on the first class after submission, and a second, more in-depth round of feedback after grading the assignments on the following Thursday.

## Workload
Although it is possible to take it for fewer credits, BBA is a seven-credit course. On average, you should expect to spend two hours working outside of class for every one hour in class, for a total of 21 hours per week. (See [Stanford's page](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/advising/student-guides/what-unit) on the amount of work per credit.)

## Respect
Our goal is to create an environment where students can grapple with deep, complex ideas about learning, technology, and education. An important part of creating that environment is fostering respect for the readings and for each other. We have found that following the following points taken from "[Fostering Moral Conversations in the College Classroom](http://socialwork.uw.edu/sites/default/files/sswfiles/Nash_fostering_moral_conversations.pdf)" by Robert J. Nash help create that atmosphere (p. 89-90).

- You make an honest effort to read texts and understand others *on their terms* as well as on your own.
- You acknowledge that although you do indeed "construct" meaning when reading a text and listening to others, you also have biases and blind spots that can be exposed, and reconstructed, by others...
- You maintain an open-mindedness about the possibility of learning something from both the author *and* your peers in the conversation.
- You agree that clarifying, questioning, challenging, exemplifying, and applying ideas are activities to be done in a self- and other-respecting way.
- *Read as you would be read. Listen as you would be listened to* (Booth, 1988).
- *T.S. Eliot once said that hell is where nothing connects. Thus, speak with, not at, or separate from, each other.* Conversational heaven is where every comment is a link in an unbroken chain.
- *If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.* But know how to stand up for what you believe without standing over, or on, others.
- *Accept no text uncritically; it might be false. Reject no text uncritically; it might be true.*
- *Find and express your own voice, but also find the right time to lower your own voice so that others might find theirs.*
- *But speak we must!* There can be no conversation unless people are willing to express their ideas, no matter how erroneous, outrageous, eccentric, enfeebled, or politically and educationally unorthodox. Remember John Stuart Mill's (1879/1982) insight: "In a democratic society, all opinions must be heard because some of them may be true; and those that aren't true must be vigorously contested. In either case, a free people only stand to gain."
- *Once you acknowledge your moral duty to speak up, even if your ideas are only half-formed or even half-baked, do not be afraid of appearing less than brilliant in your discourse.* It will be our joint responsibility to discover the "brilliance" in those observations you consider merely ordinary.

"I also ask that everyone make an effort to talk during class. If you genuinely do not have anything to present or add to the conversation *at any given time*, then, please, do not speak. This is a reasonable, even merciful, silence. But, if you *never* have anything to contribute verbally, I would question why on earth you are taking this course. This is, after all, a seminar—"a meeting of students for [the purpose of] exchanging information and holding discussions" (Random House Webster's College Dictionary, 1992). I maintain that in a seminar, making at least one verbal contribution each session is a matter of simple equity, focus, and courage. The principle of fairness demands that each participant in the conversation try to play an equal verbal role in contributing to the discussion. If some people always hold backback—no matter how valid the reason—then others have to shoulder a disproportionate responsibility to carry the conversation. This is an unjust burden. Moreover, every participant has an equal responsibility to stay focused on what is being discussed... We are all insecure when the time arrives to go public with an idea, because any personal interpreation of a reading, or of someone else's opinion, automatically makes us a very visible minority of one in a group. This can be frightening, for sure. But, as equal learners, we must summon up a little courage..." (p. 87)
