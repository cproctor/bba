Title: Week 4: Code is coming!
Date: 2018-02-01

This week in lab, we add in the last big layer of 
digital fabrication: code. We will be introducing [Processing]({filename}/modules/processing.md) 
and using our homemade tangible user interface tables to discuss some 
[higher-level programming concepts]({filename}/modules/code.md). We will differentiate
stations this week, with one group of beginners and another of people with more programming experience.

If you are the sort of person who 
likes to work through things at your own pace ahead of time (especially if code is new for you), 
we recommend playing the [Hospitals](https://github.com/cproctor/hospitals/releases/tag/v1) game ahead of time
(you'll need [Processing](https://processing.org/)) and then reading the [annotated source code](https://cproctor.github.io/hospitals/hospitals.html).
