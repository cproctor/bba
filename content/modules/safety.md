Title: Lab safety
Date: 2017-01-11

These safety norms apply at all times in the lab. There are <a href="{category}modules">additional safety precautions for each tool</a>; make sure you read these before using a tool.

- Never work alone in the woodshop.
- If you are too tired, stressed, or for any reason cannot exercise appropriate caution, do not work in the lab.
- Inappropriately operating the tools and machines in the lab may result in a time- and cost-intensive repair. This also means essential tools may be out of commission, which could prevent you from completing your projects as intended.   
- Wear appropriate safety gear and clothing for the space you are working in.
- If you are unsure of how to use a tool or machine, ASK!
- ** FIRST AID KIT: located in a cabinet with a green dog sticker, next to vacuum hoods.**
- **FIRE EXTINGUISHER: located to the right of the fume hoods by the sink.**

# Woodshop Protocol
- Hair must be tied up in a bun. No loose hair around face.
- No jewelry (including watches, bangles, necklaces, etc.). Post earrings are acceptable.
- You must wear closed-toe shoes.
- Be mindful of dust—it is carcinogenic! Always vacuum, and if there is excessive dust, wear a mask.
- Safety glasses are required at all times, even if you are not actively using a machine. 
- Wood chips may fly off of someone else’s machine unexpectedly. We value your vision!

# Storage

- Keep your items in your labeled bin. 
- You may store items in the woodshop by the backdoor. 
- If you don’t label your items, they are up for grabs! 
- If you have an item that is larger than your bin, label it and find someone on the teaching team to help you find a place for it in the lab.

# Cleanup 

- Put everything back where you found it.
- When you finish with a tool, follow the tool-specific cleanup instructions. Throw away trash and scraps which cannot be reused.
- When you are done working in the lab, find someone on the teaching team to give you a 5-minute general lab cleanup job. 
- Tabletops must be clean when you leave.

# Machine & Tool Sign-Up

- You may sign up for a machine for up to 1 hour. To sign up, use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lh3cSY9lvaJ-u0Ev4j6a9LIhPWYI8vKq1GYJeFhhH8A/edit?usp=sharing">signup spreadsheet</a>. You can't sign up for slots less than an hour in the future. 
- Sign up for up to 3 slots per week, and 1 slot per day.
- At the end of your time, regardless of whether you are done, your tool/machine must be clean and ready for the next person to use.  
- If nobody is signed up to use a tool, it's first-come first-served. If someone is waiting to use a tool and neither of you is signed up, rotate after an hour. So if (heaven forbid) you've been using a tool for a couple of hours and someone else arrives to use the tool, you may use it for an additional hour and then need to turn it over to the next user.
