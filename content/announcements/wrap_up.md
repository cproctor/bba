Title: BB&A Final Project Survey
Date: 2018-03-18

Last Thursday's expo was a really special conclusion to BB&A. We have released a short [final project survey](https://goo.gl/forms/6kzN0EYsst9n1lBd2); each student should complete this individually. This survey is focused on what we need for grading and writing feedback on your final projects. We hope you will use the regular course evaluations to give us more general feedback on BB&A. Good luck finishing up your papers and your work for other classes!
