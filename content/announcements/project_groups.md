Title: Final Project Groups
Date: 2018-02-16

Once you have decided on your final project group, please record it on 
[this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zMVWcRKzk-5zKn43LsvhhqqxmOTqj7_Z0anenwpGXlY/edit?usp=sharing). 
The teaching team will use this spreadsheet to keep track
of final project groups and progress, so please update it when/if your group 
or project changes. It was so exciting to hear all your ideas in class on Thursday!
