Beyond Bits & Atoms teaches students to design, build, and critique constructionist educational technologies. BB&A consists of a theory-oriented class (Educ 236 / CS 402) and a practice-focused lab (Educ 211 / CS 402L); students are required to enroll in both. The theory class is focused on answering three questions: 

- How does learning work?
- How does schooling work? 
- How can technology affect learning and schooling?

Students explore constructivism, constructionism, and critical pedagogy, as well as embodied and situated cognition, the role of media and tools, representations and models in learning, and theories of technology design. These ideas are applied to case studies of schools and educational technologies, and to the design of a new educational technology. 

In the lab, students are immersed in a constructionist learning environment where they reflect on their own learning processes as they learn to use technologies for prototyping and digital fabrication. Students use these tools to design nand build a constructionist educational technology. 


## Final project
The joint project for the two courses is a working prototype of a constructionist educational technology, to be displayed at the [BB&A Expo]({filename}/logistics/expo.md), and an accompanying paper suitable for submission to [IDC](http://idc-2018.org/) as a [Demo Paper](http://idc-2018.org/demos-art-installations/). In 2017, 6 papers from BB&A students and instructors were accepted to IDC. Final projects have also gone on to become commercial products.

## Grading
You will find that motivation in this class comes from your own curiosity and playfulness, augmented by tools, media, and a supportive community of learners. This is a unique opportunity at Stanford to experience constructionist learning, and motivating students with punitive grades would interfere with the dynamics which are the focus of the class. We have high expectations for students in BB&A, and the class requires a lot of work, but if you show up, work hard, and open yourself to new experiences you will end up with a good grade in the class. If you are not meeting our expectations, we will let you know early and often, so that nobody is surprised at the end of the class. Students in prior cohorts have gone on to start companies, pursue new research trajectories, or reshape their own career goals through the class. Make these your goals, rather than an A. 

You can expect regular personalized feedback on your work, in person and in writing. Assignments are evaluated using a simple scale: 

- ** &#10003; + ** Goes above and beyond the requirements of the assignment. This score recognizes really outstanding work; there is not always a specific formula for how to achieve it. 
- ** &#10003; ** Meets the requirements of the assignment. 
- ** &#10003; - ** Does not meet the requirements of the assignment. 

If you are regularly getting evaluations of &#10003; or above, you are on track for an A.




## Lab fee
The $75 lab fee supports the TLTL facilities and covers basic supplies such as cardboard, plywood, and other materials
stocked by the lab. Excellent final projects can be created using materials stocked by the lab, but students wishing 
to use materials or technologies not stocked by the lab may spend up to an additional $100.
