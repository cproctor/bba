# Safety
- Be sure that all the support systems (cooling, air, exhaust) are on before using a laser. 
- Be sure you are using materials allowed in the laser. Some materials catch on fire or release poisonous gas when used with a laser cutter. PVC and vinyl are particularly toxic. Do not cut unknown materials--it is your responsibility to make sure materials are OK to cut. 
- Double-check the power and speed settings for your material. 
- The laser beam could do a lot of harm if it escaped from the chamber. Always make sure the glass is closed. Don't put mirrors in the chamber. Make sure the crumb tray is installed. 
- If anything seems funny, stop and let a TA know. 
- If a fire starts inside the chamber, do not open it. Immediately cut power to the machine (stop button or pull the plug), turn off the compressed air and exhaust, and get the fire extinguisher. In most cases, the fire will go right out. 
- Clean up after yourself. Dust and scrap left in the laser cutter can ignite. 

# Usage
You need a raster and/or vector image to tell the laser cutter what to engrave and/or cut. To generate the image, you may use the laser cutter's proprietary software, third party software (Adobe creative suite, CorelDraw, InkScape, Gimp, etc.), download images, or generate them with code. Please have your image ready before taking up time on the physical machine. 

## Glowforge
The GlowForge is controlled via [a webapp](https://app.glowforge.com). Get the login credentials from a TA, and then you can use any computer to control the GlowForge. 

### Setup
- Be sure the exhaust fan is on whenever the GlowForge is running.

## Full-Spectrum Laser
The FS laser has a driver and software called [RetinaEngrave](https://fslaser.com/RetinaEngrave). The design software is only for Windows, but drivers are provided for Windows or Mac. 

### Setup
- Turn on the water chiller ("Industrial chiller"). It's normal for it to shriek when you turn it on. 
- Open the compressed air valve (orange). 
- Lower the sash before cutting so that exhaust stays out of the lab. 

## Epilog
The Epilog is currently out of service until we replace the laser. Check for updates here. 

## Development notes
- Discuss efficient use of materials, laying out shapes. (Show off Zuz's topo models as an extreme example of this.)

# Cleanup

- Remove scrap from the crumb tray. 
- Brush away dust. 
- Put away surplus material.
