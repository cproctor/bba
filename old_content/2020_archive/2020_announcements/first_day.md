Welcome to Beyond Bits & Atoms! Lecture will meet in GDH 361, from 10-11:40am. There are two short assigned readings for today (see the [syllabus]({filename}/pages/syllabus.html)); please make sure you have read them before class. The lab meets from 12:20-2:40 in the TLTL, at Thompson Hall 322I. Please fill out the [lab info sheet]({filename}/logistics/lab_info_sheet.md) when you have a chance.

The TLTL will be open between lecture and lab, and will also be staffed afterwards in case you want to get started on [your first assignment]({filename}/assignments/omni-animal.md). Some of the teaching team are planning to eat lunch together in the TLTL between lecture and lab, and you're welcome to join us.
