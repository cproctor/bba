Title: Lab Journals
Date: 2019-01-23

One thing that makes BBA unique is the combination of theory and practice. We don't just read educational theory, we put it to work in the lab. We don't just build neat stuff in the makerspace; our work is purposeful and reflective. Toward this end, we ask every student to maintain a lab journal, and that you make at least one post per week.

Guidelines:

- Lab journals should be some online place where you can post writing and images. Your lab journal should be accessible without the reader having to create an account. Blogger and Wordpress blogs work well; Twitter could work.
- Your lab journal is not your portfolio: The goal is to document your process, have a place to jot down thoughts, and to collect process artifacts like sketches, CAD models, and photos of whiteboarding sessions. 
- We hope you will use the lab journal as a place to use lecture readings to reflect on your work in the lab, and vice versa. There will occasionally be more specific journal prompts nudging you in this direction.
- Lab journals will be accessible to the BBA community. We will post a protected index of lab journals, so you can keep up with your peers' processes if you want. The teaching team will periodically respond to your lab journal--not in an evaluative mode, but as colleagues.
- Some people feel private about their process. Some people feel strongly about keeping lab journals on paper. If this is you, let's check in and we can work something out.
