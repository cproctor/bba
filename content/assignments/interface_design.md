Title: Interface design
Date: 2018-02-15

Design and implement the user experience for a game or for a useful application. For the purposes of this assignment, 
the nature of the game or application itself is not important. Rather, your focus will be on designing user interfaces and 
user experiences for learning. You will discuss these ideas in depth in class in upcoming weeks; taking a stab at it first
on your own will prepare you to engage more deeply with the theory later.

- **Programming**: Writing a working piece of code. The technical quality or impressiveness is not important--choose the right level of challenge for yourself.
- **Designing experiences**: Going from theory to a concept of what users will actually to to implementation
- **Connecting the interface to the code**: The interface might be physical buttons, an on-screen display, or some other surface where the user and the program meet.

## Deliverables

- Your project (if it's not working, that's fine. In that case, bring some kind of prototype to show off how it would work.)
- Your code (add comments so that another reader can understand what you're doing. This is particularly important if it doesn't work.)
- A writeup explaining your design choices in terms of learning (details coming)

## Assessment

Coming.

## Steps

- First choose the game or useful application for which you want to design an interface. This should involve GoGo boards, Processing, tangible user interface tables, 
arduino, and/or e-textiles. (If you have some other proposal, let's talk.) The game or application itself does not matter; you could do a great project with tic-tac-toe. You may choose:
    - a game provided by the teaching team (coming)
    - a game or application you write yourself, or which you wrote previously for some other purpose
    - a game or application written by somebody else, whose UX you want to rework
    - an early version of your final project
- Develop and iterate some ideas for the user interface. You will need to articulate a rationale for your choices connected to learning.
- If you are new to programming (or even if you're a pro!), now is a good time to meet with a TA or teacher. Beginners often fail to accurately estimate the difficulty of programming projects, and 
  we would like to help you avoid frustration.
- Implement the interface. Hopefully, you will end up with a working project. However, **spend no more than 10 hours on this project.** If you are getting toward the end of your allotted time, 
  stop working on the code and start working on your writeup. You can still get a check even if your code doesn't work.
