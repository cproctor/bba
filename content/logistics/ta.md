Title: TA Resources
Date: 2017-12-26

## Assignments

Each assignment should have three parts: first, an explanation of the assignment's goals and deliverables. Then an explanation of the assessment. Finally, a more detailed list of steps. This is where you should include or link to resources students will need for the assignment. Many of these resources will be contained on module (stations) pages. 

## Stations/Modules

One goal of the lab class is to introduce students to the tools in the lab. The tools are usually taught in stations--we divide the class and groups rotate through each station for about 45 minutes. Each station will have a corresponding module on the course website, with a link to the slides and a page of settings, passwords, etc. that students might need for quick reference. This page should also be printed out and posted near the tool in the lab. Be sure to address:

- safety
- cleanup
- materials storage, whether materials are provided, what to do with scrap
- software
- workflow tips
- how this tool can be used in combination with other tools
- examples of projects created using this tool
- how to learn more
- do a full demo
