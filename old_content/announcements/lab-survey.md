Title: Preparing for the first lab
Date: 2019

We can't wait to see you in the lab this afternoon. If you have a chance, please do the following before we meet at 3pm sharp:

- Create an account on [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu)
- If you plan to use your own computer in the lab, install [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/). 
  (We have plenty of lab computers, but some people like to work on their own machines.)
- Fill out this TODO [info sheet](https://goo.gl/forms/AtcUlSiRz85W1mHH3) so we can get you all set up with lab access and accounts. 
- Spend some time exploring this website. In particular, there is [documentation for every tool in the lab]({category}modules).
