Title: Upcycling
Date: 2019-01-30

Modify something you own using some digital fabrication technology in the TLTL. This is a low-stress assignment, designed to explore how digital fabrication might allow us to approach the materiality of the world around us differently, to discover affordances in what we thought was immutable. 

## Deliverables

- Bring (or wear) your modified object, ready to share how and why you modified it. If your modification didn't turn out well, prepare to share lessons learned. 
- Submit a link to a journal entry about this project. Include a short explanation of your motivation, and document your process (ideally including photos of sketches, work-in-progress, and digital assets). The intended audience is the TLTL community, particularly classmates who might not have some of the skills you have.
