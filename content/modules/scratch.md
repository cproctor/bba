## Scratch and CSV

If you want to use Scratch to generate cuts rather than engravings, you'll need to create a vector file. One way to do this is by using Inkscape's Path &gt; Trace Bitmap function, which tries to fit vectors to a raster-based image. But you can also use  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/196673177/"> the SVG Converter Scratch project</a> to generate an SVG image directly. The video below gives a demo ([Here's the project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/197999534/#editor) shown in the demo.)
