Title: Code
Date: 2017-02-01

## Goals

This station is a top-down introduction to some important programming concepts. Rather than learning the
nitty-gritty of a language, you will start with a working game, read the source code, and discuss design
considerations for your own programming. Key concepts include:

- **Model/view architecture**: Models should manage a program's state; views should manage rendering and
  user interacation. 
- **Modularity**: Small, resuable components with clear interfaces.
- **State**: A complete representation of what's happening in the app at any given time. 

## Preparation

- Download and install [Processing](https://processing.org/)
- Download the [Hospitals game](https://github.com/cproctor/hospitals/releases/tag/v1)
- Open the [annotated source code](https://cproctor.github.io/hospitals/hospitals.html)
