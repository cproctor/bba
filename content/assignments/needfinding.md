Title: Needfinding and problem statement
Index: 2.1


Generate a 1-2 page document on a problem or need in an educational setting. The goal is to get you to start thinking about potential final project ideas.

- Consider an environment: formal, informal, museum, etc.
- Think of of one or more activities or “sub” environments within this environment:
- How are things done now? Why it is not optimal?
- Approximate ideas of what the issue is, how it could be done differently, and how technology might change the way it is being done?
