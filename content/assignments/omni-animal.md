Title: Omni Animal
Date: 2018-01-11

Design and build an Omni-Animal. In this assignment, you will get comfortable with working in the TLTL, and with using the laser cutter to prototype two- and three-dimensional objects. Alternative: Propose creating another object, 
useful or beautiful, of similar complexity as an Omni-Animal. Your project should still meet the same technical requirements. 

- ** 2D design: ** Use Corel Draw or another 2D design tool to create vector-based and raster-based designs. Your omni-animal should have both cuts and etched details.
- ** Computational design: ** Write a program to generate a raster or vector image in Scratch, Python, or another interface. Some part of your omni-animal should be generated by code. 
- ** Cutting out shapes: ** Cut out shapes defined by vector images using the lasercutter. 
- ** Etching: ** Etch raster-based images using the lasercutter. 
- ** Connecting pieces: ** Create three-dimensional objects from two-dimensional components, using three types of connections: fasteners, press-fit with adhesive, and snap connector. (Your animal should use each type of connection at least once.)

## Deliverables

Be ready to show off your omni animal at the beginning of class on Week 2. On Canvas, please submit a document containing the following:

- Some evidence of your planning process. This might include photos, sketches, early prototypes. 
- The code you used to create part of your project. If you used Scratch, please share the project and include a link. If you used another platform (for example, Python's `turtle` library), please 
- Images of your final cut files.
- An informal reflection (~500 words) on your work in this project. Some questions you might choose to address:
    - What did you learn in this project? Describe your learning process. 
    - What was hard for you? Where did you get stuck, and what helped?
    - Consider the theoretical readings you have done so far. Do they ring true for you in your work on this project?
    - What new ideas did this project spark? Ideas for your final project?

## Assessment

- ** &#10003; + ** Meets all requirements described above and develops a substantially new technique. Provide a write-up for the website explaining the technique and how to use it. 
- ** &#10003; ** Meets all requirements described above.
- ** &#10003; - ** Does not meet the requirements described above.

## Steps

### Design
Using paper, cardboard, and 2D design tools, develop an idea for your omni-animal. Use <a class="module" href="{filename}/modules/scratch.md">algorithmic design</a> to generate some shapes to be cut or etched. You may find it helpful to use the provided omni-animal template as a starting point (
    [pdf]({filename}/resources/omni_animal_template_3mm.pdf)
    [ai]({filename}/resources/omni_animal_template_3mm.ai)
) Thanks to Rich Davis for creating the template.

### Prototype
Use the <a class="module" href="{filename}/modules/lasercutter.md">laser cutter</a> to fabricate your design. 
As cardboard is cheap, robust, and easy to work with, it makes an excellent prototyping material. Always cut your initial iterations with cardboard. Consider cutting a prototype before you have finalized your design--many people find 
physical prototypes help their design work. 

### Build
Once you have a final prototype, cut your final pieces out of plywood and assemble them. Note that cardboard's rigidity and thickness will not perfectly match plywood, so save time for final tweaks.
