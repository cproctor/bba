Title: Critiques
Date: 2018-03-01

The [course project]({filename}/assignments/final.md) for Beyond Bits &amp; Atoms is a working prototype of an educational technology, accompanied by a short paper suitable for submission to an academic conference. In prior years, course projects have gone on to become academic research projects and commercial products. 

On Wednesday, April 10, from 5-7pm, students will present brief pitches and initial prototypes to panels of outside educators, academics, designers, technologists, and businesspeople for feedback, critique, and discussion. This evening meeting will replace the regular lab time on that day (though the lab will be open all afternoon if you'd like to work). We recognize that evening meetings can be disruptive to your schedule, but felt it was worth it in order to bring together more of the talented professionals who live and work in this city. If you can't make it, please check in with the teaching team ahead of time and we'll figure it out.

## Critique

- 5 minutes: Students present prototypes and ask for specific feedback
- 25 minutes: Panel discussion

The primary purpose of the critiques is to help groups advance their projects in the two weeks between critiques and the final expo. We encourage critics to strike a balance between engaging with the project being presented and connecting it to broader issues in their fields of expertise. It is particularly valuable to stoke discussion between critics coming from different fields. After presenting their prototypes, we encourage students to take a listening stance, providing clarifying information as appropriate, but not necessarily defending their work against criticism.
